"""HTTP extension for pytest-loco.

The `pytest-loco-http` extension provides first-class HTTP support for the
`pytest-loco` DSL. It introduces a set of HTTP actors (`http.get`,
`http.post`, `http.put`, `http.delete`, etc.) that execute real HTTP
requests using managed sessions and return normalized, structured
response objects.
